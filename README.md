# Interships
My first Repository
This is my first own repository in github, although I contribute to some others. I am creating this so that it will be helpful for me to applyfor my interships via Internshala. 
I have acquaintance with web development and also has a habit of creating powerpoints and photoshops which I also did for school projects and fests. I also have a habit of writing stories and poems some of which I am posting here.
